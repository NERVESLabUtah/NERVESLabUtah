# The NERVES Lab

The NERVES Lab at the University of Utah is an interdisciplinary research lab focused on using electrical stimulation to improve sensorimotor 
function after neural injury. We combine concepts from engineering, neuroscience, computing science, and rehabilitation to provide solutions 
to improve walking, restore sensation, and reduce pain in both preclinical and clinical studies.
